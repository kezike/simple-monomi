6.830 Lab 1 Write-Up

Most of my implementation for lab 1 was rather straightforward. I implemented the core functions indicated and added custom classes here and there where necessary. The following is a rough list of some of the decisions I made as well as some challenges I faced throughout the lab:
- For TupleDesc, I originally implemented a custom iterator, but decided to just rely on the list iterator method, since I was storing my TDItems in a list. I repeated this pottern for other classes.
- In Catalog, I decided to implement a number of auxiliary data structures for storing data. In particular, I created four different maps to map between id and primary key, primary key and name, id and name, and name and table. My moitvation behind this decision was that there are a number of different ways in which one might ask for data and if I have multiple different O(1)-time access structures, it will be good for general time performance. If I was optimizing instead for space efficiency, I may have decided to reduce the number of indices, but I figure that we can probably get away with cahcing this indices appropriately.
- In HeapPage, my biggest struggle point was implementing isSlotUsed. The actual bit operation for doing this was rather simple and I had no problem with that. However, for some reason, triple-arrow right shifts weren't behaving the way I expected for them to: for some reason, they populate the vacant high order bits with 1s as opposed to 0s. Because of this. When I eventually learned this, I simply had to and my mask by 1 and that solved my issues. HeapPage was another class for which I was originally thinking of implementing a custom iterator. I instead decided that it would be much more intuitive to simply recreate a list that contains all of the valid tuples and use the iterator of the resulting list.
- For HeapFile's, I was originally thinking of simply following HeapPage's lead and calling the iterator of the list of valid tuples. However, I soon learned that the iterator had to implement the DbFileIterator interface. So, I implented a custom iterator for this class, which used the valid tuples list as the base collection anyway.
- For SeqScan iterator methods I simply called the iterator methods for the contained file, ensuring beforehand that the iterator is open.
- At the moment, all unit tests are passing, but systemtest is malfunctioning. I am planning on correcting this within the next day or so.
- I spent about 24-30 aggregate hours on this lab. I could have benefitted from additional help from staff, but OH far and few between and not super available to me, so I relied heavily on Piazza, which was a decent recourse, if not perfect.
